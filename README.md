# data_modeling_2 with Apache Cassandra

### Datasets
For this project, you'll be working with one dataset: event_data. 

### Build ETL Pipeline
- Implement the logic in section Part I of the notebook template to iterate through each event file in event_data to process and create a new CSV file in Python
- Make necessary edits to Part II of the notebook template to include Apache Cassandra CREATE and INSERT statements to load processed records into relevant tables in your data model
- Test by running SELECT statements after running the queries on your database
